# A Better Calculator App

The last time I made a calculator app, it was pretty simple and in my opinion didn't really do much. It didn't have support for parenthesees or decimal numbers. It also didn't have any frameworks behind it and it was just Vanilla JS with a hint of Pico CSS. In my head, it could've been much better.

And thats why I made this app.

Honestly, the usage of Svelte made this much less painful and I didn't have to use any nonsense like `document.getElementById()`. Instead, I could just bind the value. And the usage of Tailwind made this so much more customizable. Overall, it was pretty fun making this.
